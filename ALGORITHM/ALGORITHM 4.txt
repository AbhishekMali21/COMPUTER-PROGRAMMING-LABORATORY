ALGORITHM:
Step 1: [read the number N]
    	Read N

Step 2: initialize M=N,REV=0

Step 3: [check the value of  N]
        If N is not equal to 0  go to step 4 else go to step 5

Step 4: digit=N%10;
        N=N/10;
   		REV=REV*10+digit ;[executes these three steps until N value become 0] 

Step 5: check weather the M=REV if so,go to step 6 else goto step 7

Step 6: Print number is palindrome

Step 7: Print number is not palindrome  

Step 8: Stop.
