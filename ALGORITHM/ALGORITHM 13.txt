ALGORITHM:

STEP 1: [input number of students]
		Read n

STEP 2: [input details of students ie.name and marks]
		Read name,m1,m2,m3

STEP 3: [ Calculate total and average]
		For <- i=0 to n
		s[i].total=(s[i].m1+s[i].m2+s[i].m3);
		T=T+s[i].total;
		AVG=T/N;

STEP 4: [Find students above and below average]
		for <- i=0 to n
			aboveavg[j]=i;
			j++;
		else
			belowavg[k]=i;
			k++;

STEP 5: [Finished]
		STOP
