Algorithm:

Step 1: start

Step 2: read number

Step 3: if number is not equal to zero , goto step 4 else goto step 7

Step 4: calculate remainder number by 2, get n value by n divide by 2

Step 5: calculate decimal by adding decimal and remainder by multiply power of 2, i

Step 6: count by increasing i by one

Step 7: print decimal

Step 8: stop
